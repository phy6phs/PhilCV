% \textbf{Interests:} Computers, Technology, Physics, Geography, Maps, Science,
% Statistics, Programming, The Internet, Data Analysis, Skiing, Football, Travelling
A highly versatile physics PhD student with an inquisitive mind and a passion for science and 
innovation. Eager to use my four years particle physics related programming and analytical experience in ways that can be beneficial in a technological environment.

%Energy is
% something that will be needed in increasing amounts over the coming decades and
% action needs to be taken now such that it remains readily available. Working at
% SSE would give me an excellent opportunity to do this for years to come.
